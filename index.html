        <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
        <p>Through experiments on droplets, frost, fluid interfaces, and non-Brownian particles, I try to understand how simple physical interactions drive complex phenomena in nature and engineering applications. My goal is to design analogs of complex natural systems and processes and probe them for fundamental physical understanding.</p>
        <p>I have a PhD in Engineering Mechanics from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA with <a href="https://nifi.me.vt.edu">Prof. Jonathan Boreyko</a> and a postdoctoral experience with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D51DwqcAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Sungyon Lee</a> at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, USA.</p>
        <p>My research draws inspiration from technological challenges, biological systems, and ecological questions. I work with collaborators across disciplines, from plant pathologists uncovering how jumping dew droplets spread disease to engineers at Rolls-Royce developing new de-icing strategies. Explore the <em>Research Stories</em> below to see how these collaborations come to life.</p>

The results revealed that with the gentlest of breezes, natural dew cycles can enable passive dispersal of pathogens. In other words, the same physics that makes droplets jump in engineered condensers may also help spread plant epidemics.</p>

        <h3 id="Jumping-drop">Lift off and crashing back: The surprising end of jumping-droplet condensation</h3>

        <p><span class="newthought">In any heat transfer devices,</span> the condenser surface inevitably becomes covered with tiny water droplets. Removing this water is an engineering design challenge as they block efficient heat transfer. On ordinary metal surfaces, these droplets merge and eventually grow large enough to roll off under gravity, but only if the surface is at an angle other than horizontal. Superhydrophobic surfaces offer a clever alternative: their extremely low adhesion allows the excess surface energy released during merging to be converted into a out-of-plane velocity. This is the basis of <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.184501"><em>jumping-droplet condensation</em></a>, one of most efficient modes of condensation <label for="eff-cond" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label></span><input type="checkbox" id="eff-cond" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl303835d"><em>Wang et al., Nano Letters, 2012</em></a></span> discovered to date.</p>

Defects can pin droplets, slowing their departure and leading to flooding when the return of fallen droplets exceeds the rate of jumping. Even upside-down surfaces can show the surprising return of droplets, driven by vapor flow entrainment near the surface. Our experiments reveal that, over longer condensation periods (3 hours or more), tilted surfaces consistently outperform horizontal ones, where gravity lends a hand in clearing droplets and sustaining efficient heat transfer.</p>

        <p>I am looking for a faculty role. In my independent program, I will take a deep dive into patterns in the natural world. We will design physical analogs for soil, cells, and tissues, utilizing my experience with granular materials, interfacial fluid mechanics, phase change processes, and years of experimental insights.</p>
