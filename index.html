        <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
        <p>Through experiments on droplets, frost, fluid interfaces, and granular materials, I try to understand how simple physical interactions drive complex phenomena in nature and engineering applications. My goal is to design analogs of complex natural systems and processes and probe them for fundamental physical understanding.</p>
        <p>I have a PhD from Virginia Tech, USA with <a href="https://nifi.me.vt.edu">Prof. Jonathan Boreyko</a> and a postdoctoral experience with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D51DwqcAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Sungyon Lee</a> at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>
        <p>My research draws inspiration from technological challenges, biological systems, and ecological questions. I work with collaborators across disciplines, from plant pathologists uncovering how jumping dew droplets spread disease to engineers at Rolls-Royce developing new de-icing strategies. Explore the <em>Research Stories</em> below to see how these collaborations come to life.</p>

        <h3 id="Jumping-drop">Lift off and crashing back: the surprising end of jumping-droplet condensation</h3>
        <p><span class="newthought">In any heat transfer devices,</span> the condenser surface inevitably accumulates water droplets. Removing this water is an engineering challenge as they are a hinderence to efficient heat transfer. On regular metal surfaces, this is usually achieved automatically as individual droplets of water merge and become too large to fall off the surface via gravity. However, this only works when the surface is not horizontal. If the surface is superhydrophobic, the extremely low adhesion between the droplet base and the surface ensures that the energy released during merging is partly converted into an upward velocity.

While some of the jumped droplets eventually return to the surface in most cases, if the jump rate is lower than the return rate, we would eventually see flooding. Far more counter-intuitively, upside-down surfaces too, can exhibit droplet return due to vapor flow entrainment near the surface. Our experiments show that for a condensation period of 3 hrs or more, the inclined surfaces perform far better than horizontal surfaces thanks to the assistance from the gravitational departure. </p>

        <p>Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartzâ€™s <a href="http://imagequilts.com/">ImageQuilts</a>. See the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003wk">ET forum announcement thread</a> for more on quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other <code>figure</code>.</p>
        <p>This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:</p>

        <p>Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.</p>
